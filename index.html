    <p>Regular SLAM can localize the robot and create a map. But, the map that it creates is only a point cloud and carries no semantic meaning. Using deep learning, we can create the point cloud with semantic labels. Thanks to Jetson TX2, now, all of this can be done onboard and in real time.

    <h3> Single Image Augemented Reality </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Python, JavaScript, flask, Tensorflow, 3D Reconstruction </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Augmented Reality (AR) have grown in popularity in recent years. Established large companies and start-ups alike are exploring new ways to firstly create reliable AR and secondly to deploy it in a real-world application. A reliable AR is achieved by accurate and consistent localization of the camera or the object of interest in the scene. SLAM and tracking are common approaches. Numerous applications can be developed on top of this base system. Games, Advertisement, Guides, and
    most importantly, putting puppy ears on people's head.
    
    We developed a single image 3D AR system with the scale at Pair3D. The system is developed on an AWS and is accessible through a web AP</p>

    <h3> 3D Reconstruction </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> python, flask, 3D reconstruction </li>
    </ul>

    <p>3D modeling is a classical computer vision which has been studied for many years. Approaches for both active(Kinect, Lidar) and passive(RGB cameras) sensors have developed with a varying success. While active sensors based methods are capable getting accurate models in real time, their usages are still limited. RGB camera is one of the most widely available sensors to the users and therefore, 3D reconstruction using this type of sensors is desirable. Especially the approaches that
    do not require any collaboration from the end user. 

    Shape from Motion method is a suitable approach. It uses raw images with no calibration needed and can generate 3D models up to the scale. 

    We developed a 3D reconstruction API that accepts images or videos and generates and visualizes output models. Different methods are available to achieve the best performance for each scenario.

    <h3> Relocalization in the Wild </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> python, Caffe, Flask </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The video below is showcasing our matching system performance. In this example, I used google street view API to get real images from streets. Two different positions of the camera were chosen each with 360-degree view. The location is the University of Alberta Campus and the camera positions are on different sides of a street. For each image in the first camera position (left image), the closest match to the second camera position (right image) was found using the system.</p>

    <h3> Convolutional Gated Recurrent Networks for Video Segmentation </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Python, DeepLearning, Theano  </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Semantic segmentation has recently witnessed major progress, where fully convolutional neural networks have shown to perform well. However, most of the previous work focused on improving single image segmentation. To our knowledge, no prior work has made use of temporal video information in a recurrent network. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to implicitly utilize temporal data in videos for online semantic segmentation. The method relies on a fully
    convolutional network that is embedded into a gated recurrent architecture. This design receives a sequence of consecutive video frames and outputs the segmentation of the last frame. Convolutional gated recurrent networks are used for the recurrent part to preserve spatial connectivities in the image. Our proposed method can be applied in both online and batch segmentation. This architecture is tested for both binary and semantic video segmentation tasks. Experiments are
    conducted on the recent benchmarks in SegTrack V2, Davis, CityScapes, and Synthia. Using recurrent fully convolutional networks improved the baseline network performance in all of our experiments. Namely, 5% and 3% improvement of F-measure in SegTrack2 and Davis respectively, 5.7% improvement in mean IoU in Synthia and 3.5% improvement in categorical mean IoU in CityScapes. The performance of the RFCN network depends on its baseline fully convolutional network. Thus RFCN architecture
    can be seen as a method to improve its baseline segmentation network by exploiting spatiotemporal information in videos.</p>
